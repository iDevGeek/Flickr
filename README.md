This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Flickr API example
This SPA consumes Flickr API and presents the results in a simple grid. It uses Redux for state management and ReactRouter for routing. The interface presents a simple "search" which is based on the tag data from the Flickr feed.
